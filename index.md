### About Me

here's some stuff about me, of course it's kept to a bare minimum to prevent the Feds from tracking me down and stealing my garlic bread

I go to a school in Texas, this school is nice, I work at a resteraunt, I have 3 cats and a dog, I am Mexican American, I like mintchip icecream, I enjoy getting really stupid things to work.
